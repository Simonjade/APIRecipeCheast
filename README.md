# API Recipe Cheast

:bangbang: :bangbang: This project is currently under construction/refactoring. 
Since the beginning of this project, I have evolved in my use of SQL, and new things are therefore being implemented like functions in SQL or PL/pgSQL for all request (done for user CRUD), unit test, use of schema in my bdd, JWT authentication, protected route, log and errorHandling. :bangbang: :bangbang:
